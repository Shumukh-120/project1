⚡ Energy System Digital Twin with Predictive AI

 🌟 Overview
An end-to-end integrated platform that synergizes Digital Twin simulation for energy systems with advanced Artificial Intelligence to enable proactive fault detection and predictive maintenance.

 🧠 My Core Contribution (AI & Machine Learning)
As the Lead AI Developer for this project, I engineered the "Intelligent Core" of the system. My responsibilities included:

  Predictive Modeling: Architected and deployed machine learning models in ONNX and PKL formats to predict system health.
  Backend API Development: Developed test_api.py to facilitate seamless integration between AI models and the digital twin environment. Data Engineering: Performed extensive      data cleaning and feature engineering on industrial datasets like ai4i2020_cleaned.csv.

 👥 Collaboration & Integration
  AI & Predictive Analytics: Developed by me (Shumukh-120).
  System Simulation & Frontend: Developed by @Amanimira, located in the App_Frontentend directory.​
