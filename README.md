​🧠 My Core Contribution (AI & Machine Learning)
​As the Lead AI Developer for this project, I engineered the "Intelligent Core" of the system. My responsibilities included:
​Predictive Modeling: Architected and deployed machine learning models in ONNX and PKL formats to predict system health and maintenance requirements.
​Backend API Development: Developed test_api.py to facilitate seamless integration and communication between the AI models and the digital twin environment.
​Data Engineering: Performed extensive data cleaning and feature engineering on large-scale industrial datasets, such as ai4i2020_cleaned.csv.
​👥 Collaboration & Integration
​This repository represents a successful integration of specialized domains:
​AI & Predictive Analytics: Developed by me (Shumukh-120).
​System Simulation & Frontend: Developed by @Amanimira, located in the App_Frontentend directory.
